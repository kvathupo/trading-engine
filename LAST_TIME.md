# Last Time
* Move World to be a module
* Set up gtest
* Write World timing test
* Set up linter

# What not to worry about for now
In order of decreasing relevance:
* Running metabacktests
    * Intraday timing granularity
* Order book
* Matching Engine
    * Assume perfect for now
* Passing in fixed buffer to world init would be fun

# Possible Utilities
